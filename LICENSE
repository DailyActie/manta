This is a modified version of the mantaflow library for the paper "Accelerating
Eulerian Fluid Simulation With Convolutional Networks".

Modifications:

1. Added hooks to export training data to a custom binary format.
2. Minor modifications to the solver itself (some bug fixes and returned debug
   information).
3. Added new scene to generate our own training data.
